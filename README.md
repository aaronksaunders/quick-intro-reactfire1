# Quick Intro To ReactJS ReactFire

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview


In part one, We set up the firebase project and connected it all to the firebase emulator for authentication and account creation all using reactfire. We will build the login screen and the home screen in this example. The starting point will be using a blank app generated with create-react-app

In part two we are querying documents from firestore and setting up the created crud actions using the reactfire firebase hooks
